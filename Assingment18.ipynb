    "#### 1. Can we use Bagging for regression problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer -> Yes. You use a Bagging Regressor. Instead of voting (used in classification), it calculates the average (mean) of the predictions from all the base models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What is the difference between multiple model training and single model training?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "Single Model Training relies on one algorithm to find a single best hypothesis, which often leads to high variance (overfitting). Multiple Model Training (Ensemble) combines several models to smooth out errors, resulting in a more stable and generalized prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Explain the concept of feature randomness in Random Forest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "Unlike a standard Decision Tree that searches all features for the best split, Random Forest searches only a random subset of features at each node split. This forces trees to be different (decorrelated), which improves the ensemble's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What is OOB (Out-of-Bag) Score? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "It is a validation metric calculated using the Out-of-Bag samples—the data points that were not included in the bootstrap sample for a specific tree. It acts as a built-in cross-validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. How can you measure the importance of features in a Random Forest model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "You can use Gini Importance (measures how much a feature reduces impurity across all trees) or Permutation Importance (measures how much accuracy drops when a feature's values are randomly shuffled).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Explain the working principle of a Bagging Classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "It uses Bootstrap Aggregating. It creates multiple training sets by sampling with replacement, trains a model on each set in parallel, and combines predictions via majority voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. How do you evaluate a Bagging Classifier’s performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "You can use standard classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) on a test set, or use the OOB Score to estimate performance without a separate validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. How does a Bagging Regressor work? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "It works effectively the same as the classifier, but instead of voting on classes, it aggregates the continuous output of base models by taking the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. What is the main advantage of ensemble techniques? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "They reduce variance and overfitting. By combining models, the ensemble is more robust and accurate than any single individual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. What is the main challenge of ensemble methods? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "Complexity and Interpretability. They are computationally expensive to train/deploy and are often \"black boxes,\" making it hard to explain exactly why a specific prediction was made compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11. Explain the key idea behind ensemble techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "The \"Wisdom of Crowds.\" A group of \"weak learners\" (models slightly better than random) can come together to form a \"strong learner\" that corrects individual errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12. What is a Random Forest Classifier? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "An ensemble algorithm that applies Bagging specifically to Decision Trees, adding an extra layer of randomness by using feature subsets. It is one of the most popular and versatile machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 13. What are the main types of ensemble techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) - e.g., Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting (Sequential learning) - e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking (Meta-learning) - Combining different types of models with a final meta-learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 14. What is ensemble learning in machine learning? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "A technique that combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models to produce a single predictive model with better performance than any of the constituent models alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 15. When should we avoid using ensemble methods? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "Avoid them when you need highly interpretable results (e.g., explaining a loan denial strictly), when you have limited computational power (memory/CPU), or when ultra-low latency (speed) is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 16. How does Bagging help in reducing overfitting? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "By training on different subsets of data, the individual models make different errors. When you average them (or vote), the random errors cancel out, leaving the true signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 17. Why is Random Forest better than a single Decision Tree? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "A single tree tends to memorize the training data (high variance/overfitting). Random Forest fixes this by averaging many trees, creating a low-variance model that generalizes better to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18. What is the role of bootstrap sampling in Bagging? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "It creates diversity. By giving each model a slightly different version of the dataset, it ensures the models aren't identical, which is required for the ensemble to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 19. What are some real-world applications of ensemble techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "Finance: Credit scoring and fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medicine: Diagnosing diseases from medical imaging (tumors, retinopathy).\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce: Product recommendation engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 20. What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer ->\n",
    "Bagging: Trains models in parallel (independently) to reduce variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting: Trains models in sequence (each correcting the previous one) to reduce bias."
